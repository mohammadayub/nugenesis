                    <b>The NuGenesis flagship: NU Coin</b>
                </h3>
                <div class="text-justify text-secondary">
                    <p>
                        NuCoin is the native currency in the NuGenesis ecosystem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NuGenesis’ flagship blockchain, NU Coin, is a fully operational and is already at zero-carbon emission. It is way past the POW vs POS debate!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With Proof of Authority with useful work AI (Artificial Intelligence) as one of several consensus mechanisms, including consensus before packing, NuGenesis’ NuCoin uses system validator nodes running on the randomness of a round robin protocol and monitored by AI to underscore system integrity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The streamlined validation process, through the super nodes with byzantine fault tolerance and randomness, reduces unnecessarily superfluous broadcasting through validation networks. Being gas less, there are no requests from 1000’s of validators and fee actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NuCoin integrates blockchain load balancers and system validators to efficiently flow data into infinite parallel processing blockchains. It achieves unlimited scalability and transaction speeds. The more users, the faster the transaction speed!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NuCoin has multiple uses in the NuGenesis ecosystem. It is the principal currency for all services available (and NuCoin is burned on use), including the currency used in the NuTech cities and special economic zones established with participating jurisdictions. NuCoin is essential for staking by all projects as an effective “fee” for using the system. NuCoin is essential to the ranks involved in the Governance system. The ownership of NuCoin is designed to be widely dispersed, by contrast to tems with the intended effect that users are motivated to establish their substantial economic presence in the NuGenesis ecosystem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whilst a number of NuGenesis projects ( such Ledger X, Just Social, the Metarealm, V2R etc) will stand on their own with their own digital assets, NuCoin holders will always be entitled to early and preferential access to these projects.

                        For the lovers of the classic Bitcoin protocol but for whom the excessive energy demands of the mathematical processes to secure the bitcoin network are too great, NuGenesis has worked with certain Bitcoin devs to create Bitcoin Nu. The system retains the Bitcoin open source code with all the benefits of the robustness from over 12 years to testing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The chain proves have that with code change alone unnecessary complexity can be removed and the consequent computational power expended. Most of the environmental problems can be minimised.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mining can be achieved by ordinary users on their laptops as intended by Satoshi. They prevent the ASIC mining that uses the unnecessary resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Simultaneously, they can achieve scalability and efficient transaction speed: that is to 1 minute block finalisation, increasing the transaction speed from 45 T/per second as compared to the current 7 T/per second.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To offset the carbon footprint of the BTCNU mined, NuGenesis has added an offset treasury “‘Treasury’ Offset anti-carbon system wallet” to collect a portion of mined coins to fund ‘carbon offset’ programs such as reforestation projects.

This blockchain uses proof of useful work AI as at consensus mechanism. They incorporate NAVIS (NuGenesis Artifical Validation Intellegence System) to ensure system security and integrity. Dedicated sub-treasuries are available for specific ‘carbon offset’ projects in reforestation and soil rejuvination. Minting mechansims and staking protocols replace the current halving algaorithims and complexity rates. The speeds here are testing at 1, 500-100,00 T/per second

                        A troy is a token to represent the fiat currency representation in physical gold. For example Troy USD (TUSD) Troy Euro (TEURO) Tory AUD (TAUD) etc. It functions similar to a stable coin and a remittance tool.

                        Troys are designed to provide liquidity to crypto markets and be a secure and reliable bridging currency. Troys are designed to meet inflationary concerns. Users can be confident that each Troy is based on the dominated fiat jurisdiction’s equivalent in actual physical gold vaulted by the particpating financial institutions and can be exchanged for that fiat currency.

                        Troys are issued under regulatory licence in Australia. The prototype is built using 5 cross chains pegged to gold and major currencies and the gasless nature of the NuGenesis blockchain system permits exchange efficiency.

                        The NuGenesis innovation to facilitate mass adoption by the mainstream economy is to go beyond existing limitations of smart contract protocols. Smart Contract Digital Notarised Contracts™ (DNCs) allow for parties to transact with more comprehensive contracts that cater for a wide range of terms and conditions to cater for the various possibilities that can arise, and consequent allocation of risks in common business practices. The AI capability will build suggested templates of contracts and instruments in an increasingly number of commercial scenarios.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The AI will pull the suggested templates to a contemplated transaction, fill in the data from the respective chains and wallet IDs, and the counterparties have signed the respective DNC, the system will witness and notarise the DNC by time-stamp hash it with a unique identifier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Transactional scenarios may require money to be held in trust wallets, with or without multi-sigs, and impose standard business customs such as for example SGC inspections for import/export contracts. The Ledger X blockchain system allows for smart contract developers to innovate with parallel processing in the smart contract protocols removing the limitation of liner time ordering and allowing for the flexibility for both vertical and horizontal events to be incorporated.

To encourage the shift from the rather static NFTs that are currently in existence, to more interactive NFTs. NFTs that transcend art into gaming. NFTs that level up as they interact whether competing or being part of a collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interactive NFTs are vehicles for business records: ID’s, driver’s licences, medical records for example. Interactive NFTs can become part of the metarealm. When interactive NFTs need millions of transactions per second, or as part of the meta-realm, billions of transactions per second, the multi-chain parallel processing can deliver it. There is no competition.

                        NuGenesis offers crypto projects of all sizes the ability to customise their blockchains according to evolving needs. A fledging project may seed fund through the V2R (Vision to Reality) Launchpad. It may use the NuGenesis next gen Smart Chain to create coins or tokens at either Layer 1 or Layer 2.

                    <p>
                        A more advanced project may wish to be a para-chain to economise the on-going infrastructure costs such as storage and security. Another may prefer its own sovereign parallel processing with any drain on its/or the systems resources.

                    <p>
                        Projects may customise blockchains with classes of transactions using differentially private permissioned chains for sensitive information, and open sourced and decentralised chains otherwise. They may tailor and modify the perfect configuration for its business evolution.

                    <p>
                        Ledger X is fully fledged (fiat/crypto) exchange where prices are determined by the brutality of the open market. It was designed to be an important part of the NuGenesis ecosystem to ensure capital is to be allocated by the market rather than bond curves and technocratic formulae.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ledger X is decentralised in that, unlike say Binance which has a central point of data storage, the data is decentralised with the 11 witness nodes across the globe. This offers a vital security advantage without compromising the instant settlement time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The decentralisation is designed to encourage users to consolidate their holdings; view; monitor and manage their portfolio; apply metrics and analytics available without the risks of a centralised exchange. Assets from other blockchains can be deposited whilst remaining interoperable. With multi-sig, treasury wallets and allowing users to keep their private keys, it is intended to provide the user experience comfort needed to optimise mass adoption.

                    <p>
                        Ledger X is scalable and high performance; it is designed for new projects to cheaply and efficiently create or mint coins to make available to the open market, or for existing projects to obtain further liquidity through supplemental release mechanisms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Leger X exchange is a parallel processing tri blockchain configuration

                    <p>
                        The three chains include:
                    </p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            Settlement chain;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Match chain; and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Content chain
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        which are running parallel together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The consensus mechanism involves two major protocols:
                    </p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            Delegated Revenue Proof of Stake; and,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Consensus before packing
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        the combined effect of which is that the transaction has already been processed when it goes through the block. This tri-chain concurrent processing achieves a 1 second block speed creation finality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user therefore experiences a completed order within 1 second; a speed comparable to a centralised exchange.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The settlement chain effects the ‘consensus before packing’ and the settlement. The content chain stores the data on finality, and the match chain matches the data (order matching) when trying to resolve it or search it. An explorer search will identify the ID of multiple transactions however they are processed as between the blockchains

                            Like the NuGenesis blockchain, it is scalable such that parallel chains can be created and bridged. It is flexible in that it allows developers to create more vertical side-chain scenario. There are globally dispersed super-nodes. The 11 witness nodes are Super-nodes that are deployed in 8 countries on four continents.

                            The cross-chain protocol allows assets on other public chains to be anchored though smart contracts and scripts to create or be part of newly created crypto assets on the users’ Ledger X exchange wallets.

                            A current limitation of smart contracts is that they are not designed with parallel computing in mind and operate on a linear time ordering process. The Ledger X side-Chain protocol allows smart contract developers to introduce side chain mechanisms that concurrently process providing greater flexibility for vertical side chain scenarios.
