        "p2": "Ledger X is decentralised in that, unlike say Binance which has a central point of data storage, the data is decentralised with the 11 witness nodes across the globe. This offers a vital security advantage without compromising the instant settlement time.",
        "p3": "The decentralisation is designed to encourage users to consolidate their holdings; view; monitor and manage their portfolio; apply metrics and analytics available without the risks of a centralised exchange. Assets from other blockchains can be deposited whilst remaining interoperable. With multi-sig, treasury wallets and allowing users to keep their private keys, it is intended to provide the user experience comfort needed to optimise mass adoption.",

        "p12": "The settlement chain effects the 'consensus before packing' and the settlement. The content chain stores the data on finality, and the match chain matches the data (order matching) when trying to resolve it or search it. An explorer search will identify the ID of multiple transactions however they are processed as between the blockchains",
        "p13": "Like the NuGenesis blockchain, it is scalable such that parallel chains can be created and bridged. It is flexible in that it allows developers to create more vertical side-chain scenario. There are globally dispersed super-nodes. The 11 witness nodes are Super-nodes that are deployed in 8 countries on four continents.",
        "p14": "The cross-chain protocol allows assets on other public chains to be anchored though smart contracts and scripts to create or be part of newly created crypto assets on the users' Ledger X exchange wallets.",
        "p15": "A current limitation of smart contracts is that they are not designed with parallel computing in mind and operate on a linear time ordering process. The Ledger X side-Chain protocol allows smart contract developers to introduce side chain mechanisms that concurrently process providing greater flexibility for vertical side chain scenarios."
