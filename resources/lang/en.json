        "p10": "NuGenesis offers crypto projects of all sizes the ability to customise their blockchains according to evolving needs. A fledging project may seed fund through the V2R (Vision to Reality) Launchpad. It may use the NuGenesis next gen Smart Chain to create coins or tokens at either Layer 1 or Layer 2.",
        "p11": "A more advanced project may wish to be a para-chain to economise the on-going infrastructure costs such as storage and security. Another may prefer its own sovereign parallel processing with any drain on its/or the systems resources.",
        "p12": "Projects may customise blockchains with classes of transactions using differentially private permissioned chains for sensitive information, and open sourced and decentralised chains otherwise. They may tailor and modify the perfect configuration for its business evolution."

        "p2": "Ledger X is fully fledged (fiat/crypto) exchange where prices are determined by the brutality of the open market. It was designed to be an important part of the NuGenesis ecosystem to ensure capital is to be allocated by the market rather than bond curves and technocratic formulae.",
        "p3": "Ledger X is decentralised in that, unlike say Binance which has a central point of data storage, the data is decentralised with the 11 witness nodes across the globe. This offers a vital security advantage without compromising the instant settlement time.",
        "p4": "The decentralisation is designed to encourage users to consolidate their holdings; view; monitor and manage their portfolio; apply metrics and analytics available without the risks of a centralised exchange. Assets from other blockchains can be deposited whilst remaining interoperable. With multi-sig, treasury wallets and allowing users to keep their private keys, it is intended to provide the user experience comfort needed to optimise mass adoption.",
        "p5": " What to know a bit more? Link",
        "p6": "Ledger X is scalable and high performance; it is designed for new projects to cheaply and efficiently create or mint coins to make available to the open market, or for existing projects to obtain further liquidity through supplemental release mechanisms.",

        "p17": "The user therefore experiences a completed order within 1 second; a speed comparable to a centralised exchange.",
        "p18": "The settlement chain effects the �consensus before packing� and the settlement. The content chain stores the data on finality, and the match chain matches the data (order matching) when trying to resolve it or search it. An explorer search will identify the ID of multiple transactions however they are processed as between the blockchains",
        "p19": "Like the NuGenesis blockchain, it is scalable such that parallel chains can be created and bridged. It is flexible in that it allows developers to create more vertical side-chain scenario. There are globally dispersed super-nodes. The 11 witness nodes are Super-nodes that are deployed in 8 countries on four continents.",
        "p20": "The cross-chain protocol allows assets on other public chains to be anchored though smart contracts and scripts to create or be part of newly created crypto assets on the users� Ledger X exchange wallets.",
        "p21": "A current limitation of smart contracts is that they are not designed with parallel computing in mind and operate on a linear time ordering process. The Ledger X side-Chain protocol allows smart contract developers to introduce side chain mechanisms that concurrently process providing greater flexibility for vertical side chain scenarios."
