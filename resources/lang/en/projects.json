      "p6": "The streamlined validation process, through the super nodes with byzantine fault tolerance and randomness, reduces unnecessarily superfluous broadcasting through validation networks. Being gas less, there are no requests from 1000’s of validators and fee actions.",
      "p7": "NuCoin integrates blockchain load balancers and system validators to efficiently flow data into infinite parallel processing blockchains. It achieves unlimited scalability and transaction speeds. The more users, the faster the transaction speed!",
      "p8": "NuCoin has multiple uses in the NuGenesis ecosystem. It is the principal currency for all services available (and NuCoin is burned on use), including the currency used in the NuTech cities and special economic zones established with participating jurisdictions. NuCoin is essential for staking by all projects as an effective “fee” for using the system. NuCoin is essential to the ranks involved in the Governance system. The ownership of NuCoin is designed to be widely dispersed, by contrast to tems with the intended effect that users are motivated to establish their substantial economic presence in the NuGenesis ecosystem.",
      "p9": "Whilst a number of NuGenesis projects ( such Ledger X, Just Social, the Metarealm, V2R etc) will stand on their own with their own digital assets, NuCoin holders will always be entitled to early and preferential access to these projects."

Dedicated sub-treasuries are available for specific ‘carbon offset’ projects in reforestation and soil rejuvination.
